TreeSim_Lpy
============


TreeSim_Lpy is a tree modelling tool which is built upon L-py with the added features of pruning
and tying trees down to mimic different architectures. The tool uses python and prior knowledge of L-systems
and L-Py is needed to work with this tool. You can find the L-Py documentation at 
<https://lpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest>
